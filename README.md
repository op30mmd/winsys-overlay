## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

1.  **Visual Studio**: [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) with "Desktop development with C++" and ".NET desktop development" workloads.
2.  **.NET SDK**: [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later).
3.  **CMake**: Download from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/)
4.  **Qt 6**: Download the [Qt Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
    - Select Qt 6.x version for MSVC 2019/2022 64-bit
    - Ensure **Qt Widgets** module is included

### Build Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/op30mmd/winsys-overlay.git
    cd winsys-overlay
    ```

2.  **Create build directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3.  **Configure with CMake:**
    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual Qt installation path
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\6.9.1\msvc2022_64
    ```

4.  **Build the C# Temperature Reader:**
    ```bash
    cd ../ # Return to the root directory
    dotnet publish TempReader.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false
    ```
    This will create a `TempReader.exe` in `bin/Release/net6.0/win-x64`.

5.  **Copy Dependencies:**
    - Copy the compiled `TempReader.exe` to the `build/Release` directory.
    - Copy `libs/lhm/LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll` to the `build/Release` directory.

6.  **Build the main application:**
    ```bash
    cd build # Return to the build directory
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```

### Automated Builds

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow for automated building:
- Supports self-hosted Windows runners
- Automatic dependency resolution with windeployqt
- Optional UPX compression for smaller executables
- Automated releases on version tags

## Technical Implementation

### System Monitoring Architecture
- **Hybrid C++/C# Approach**: The core application is built with C++ and Qt for performance and a native feel, while temperature monitoring is handled by a separate C# helper process.
- **LibreHardwareMonitor Integration**: The C# `TempReader.exe` utility uses the `LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll` to query CPU and GPU temperatures, supporting a wide range of hardware from vendors like Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA.
- **Inter-Process Communication**: The main C++ application launches `TempReader.exe` in the background, capturing its standard output to retrieve temperature data. This isolates the .NET environment from the main application, minimizing dependencies.
- **Windows PDH API**: Native Performance Data Helper for efficient system metrics for all other data points.
- **Multi-Query Design**: Separate PDH queries for CPU, Disk, GPU, Network, and Temperature monitoring
- **Smart Caching**: Optimized data collection to minimize system impact
- **Wildcard Counter Expansion**: Automatically detects available GPU engines and network interfaces

### Data Persistence
- **QSettings Integration**: Cross-platform settings storage
- **Daily Usage Tracking**: Persistent network usage with automatic cleanup
- **Position Memory**: Remembers overlay position between sessions

### Windows Integration
- **Always-On-Top Enforcement**: Periodic re-assertion of topmost window status
- **Transparent Background**: Native transparency support with customizable opacity
- **System API Integration**: Direct Windows API calls for enhanced functionality

## Performance Considerations

The overlay is designed to be lightweight and efficient:
- **Minimal CPU Impact**: Optimized update cycles and efficient API usage
- **Memory Efficient**: Smart counter management and automatic cleanup
- **Configurable Updates**: Adjustable refresh rates to balance accuracy and performance
- **GPU Monitoring**: Non-intrusive GPU utilization tracking across all engines
